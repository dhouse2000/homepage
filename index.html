<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm from Conway, Arkansas, United States.  I love board games and puzzles.  I enjoy recreational mathematics and foreign languages.</p>

<h1>My Background</h1>
<p>At university I studied classical Latin and found my love of languages.  After graduating, I moved to Japan to teach English as a Foreign Language and stayed several years learning about Japanese language and culture.  I moved back to the United States to get my Master of Arts in Teaching.  I've been working as an educator in various capacities, most notably as instructor of Japanese at the University of Central Arkansas.</p>

<h1>Why Coding?</h1>
<p>I like solving problems, especially practical problems.  I would like to use coding to help make people's lives easier.</p>
